### Hi there 👋

My name is Jason, a young student and a programming enthusiast ☺️
This is my first experience using github, so probably it's not to good, but soon I'll make it better

## A little description about me
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of programming. Why? because I'm still a starter in the world of programming and computer science
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with several organization with technological background to further sharpen my newly found skills.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with many people out there that already have a deep knowledge in technology, such as AI, cloud computing and many more.
    And wishes that with working together with them, I can learn a lot of new things about something that I really like.

## Languages I've learned 💻

- Python
- C++
- C
- HTML/CSS
